/// The most commonly-used kind of subplot is a two-dimensional Cartesian subplot. Traces compatible with these subplots 
/// support xaxis and yaxis attributes whose values must refer to corresponding objects in the layout portion of the figure. 
/// For example, if xaxis="x", and yaxis="y" (which is the default) then this trace is drawn on the subplot at the intersection 
/// of the axes configured under layout.xaxis and layout.yaxis, but if xaxis="x2" and yaxis="y3" then the trace is drawn at the 
/// intersection of the axes configured under layout.xaxis2 and layout.yaxis3. Note that attributes such as layout.xaxis and 
/// layout.xaxis2 etc do not have to be explicitly defined, in which case default values will be inferred. Multiple traces of 
/// different types can be drawn on the same subplot.
///
/// X- and Y-axes support the type attribute, which enables them to represent continuous values (type="linear", type="log"), 
/// temporal values (type="date") or categorical values (type="category", type="multicategory). Axes can also be overlaid on 
/// top of one another to create dual-axis or multiple-axis charts. 2-d cartesian subplots lend themselves very well to creating 
/// "small multiples" figures, also known as facet or trellis plots.
///
/// The following trace types are compatible with 2D-cartesian subplots via the xaxis and yaxis attributes:
///
/// - scatter-like trace types: scatter and scattergl can be used to draw scatter plots, line plots and curves, time-series plots, 
/// bubble charts, dot plots and filled areas and also support error bars
///
/// - bar, funnel, waterfall: bar-like trace types which can also be used to draw timelines and Gantt charts
///
/// - histogram: an aggregating bar-like trace type
///
/// - box and violin: 1-dimensional distribution-like trace types
///
/// - histogram2D and histogram2Dcontour: 2-dimensional distribution-like density trace types
///
/// - image, heatmap and contour: matrix trace types
///
/// - ohlc and candlestick: stock-like trace types
///
/// - splom: multi-dimensional scatter plots which implicitly refer to many 2-d cartesian subplots at once.

To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question.

    /// <param name="YAxis">Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.</param>
    /// <param name="Orientation">Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not if it is `false`.

    /// <param name="StackGroup">Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.</param>
    /// <param name="XPeriod">Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or "M&lt;n&gt;" on the x axis. Special values in the form of "M&lt;n&gt;" could be used to declare the number of months. In this case `n` must be a positive integer.</param>
    /// <param name="XPeriodAlignment">Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the alignment of data points on the x axis.</param>
    /// <param name="XPeriod0">Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis.

    /// <param name="ConnectGaps">Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.</param>
    /// <param name="Fill">Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy" fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.</param>
    /// <param name="FillColor">Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.</param>
    /// <param name="HoverLabel">Sets the style of the hoverlabels of this trace.</param>
    /// <param name="HoverOn">Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there are no markers or text, then the default is "fills", otherwise it is "points".</param>
    /// <param name="StackGaps">Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at which other traces in this group have data but this one does not. With "infer zero" we insert a zero at these locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate between existing values, and extrapolate a constant beyond the existing values.</param>
    /// <param name="XCalendar">Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.</param>
    /// <param name="YCalendar">Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.</param>
    /// <param name="UIRevision">Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.</param>
