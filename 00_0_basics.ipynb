"\n",
"Plotly.NET is a .NET wrapper for creation of [plotly charts]() written in F#. This means that, under the hood, all functionality creates JSON objects that can be rendered by plotly.\n",
"\n",
"The central type that gets created by all Chart constructors is `GenericChart`, which itself represents either a single chart or a multi chart (as a Discriminate Union type). It looks like this:\n",

"\n",
"- `Trace` is in principle the representation of a dataset on a chart, including for example the data itself, color and shape of the visualization, etc.\n",
"- `Layout` is everything of the chart that is not dataset specifivc - e.g. the shape and style of axes, the chart title, etc.\n",
"- `Config` is an object that configures high level properties of the chart like making all chart elements editable or the tool bar on top\n",
"- `DisplayOptions` is an object that contains meta information about how the html document that contains the chart.\n",

"### Dynamic object style\n",
"\n",
"Plotly.NET has multiple abstraction layers to work with `GenericChart`s. The prime directive for all functions provided by this library is the construction of valid plotly JSON objects.\n",
"For this purpose, `Trace`, `Layout`, and `Config` (and many other internal objects) are inheriting from [`DynamicObj`](https://github.com/plotly/Plotly.NET/blob/dev/src/Plotly.NET/DynamicObj.fs),\n",
"an extension of `DynamicObject` which makes it possible to set arbitraryly named and typed properties of these objects via the `?` operator.\n",
"\n",
"So if you want to set any kind of property on one of these objects you can do it in a very declarative way like this:\n",
